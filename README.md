The different OpenCV functions used are:
- Resizing images
- Changing colorscale
- Image segmentation
- Detecting edges
- Eroding and Dilating images
- Blur, Gaussian Blur, Median Blur, Bilateral filters
- Morphological operations
- Bitwise operations
- Histogram equillization
- Altering pixel values
- Writing text over images
- Drawing shapes over images
- Blending images
